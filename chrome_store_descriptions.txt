## Permission Justifications

### storage permission
This extension uses chrome.storage API to save the list of blocked authors and filtering preferences.

### Remote code
This extension does not use remote code. All functionality is contained within the extension package and no external code is loaded.

## Data Usage Statement
This extension does not collect or transmit any user data to external servers. All blocked author lists and filtering preferences are stored locally in the user's browser only. The extension contains no analytics or tracking code and does not share user data with third parties.
